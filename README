lib99 is a simple collection of mini-libraries for C99.

Targeted operating system is linux (but anything POSIX and C99 compliant
should work).

The rules for this collection are simple:
 - Each library consists of three files:
     lib.c:       source code
     lib.h:       header file
     lib_test.c:  unit tests
 - There are no interdependencies between libraries.
 - Minimum amount of external dependencies (zero or stdlib only is the best).
 - Permissive license (BSD-like, MIT-like, public domain, etc.)
 - Awesome code.
